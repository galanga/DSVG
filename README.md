# DSVG
Verbose SVG extensions for humans and computers.

DSVG is an xsl preprocessor for SVG that allows the SVG path object to
be represented in a more verbose format, easier for humans to understand
and modify.

Goals:

* Expand terse native representation of SVG path elements.
* Remain renderable in-browser.
* gzip representation not appreciably longer than native SVG.
